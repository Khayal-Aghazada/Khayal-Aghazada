# Khayal Aghazada ‚Äî ML/CV Engineer ¬∑ Front-End Developer

I build end-to-end computer-vision systems in Python and the UIs that operate them.  
PyTorch/ONNX/OpenCV for training and real-time inference. React/JS for clean, responsive front ends.

## Focus
- **Computer Vision & ML:** dataset curation, training/eval (AUC/AUPRC), ONNX/real-time inference, FastAPI services.
- **Front End:** React apps, API integration, routing/forms, accessible responsive UI, basic testing and CI.

## How I work
- Module-first design: small, reusable Python/JS packages with clear interfaces (no copy-paste).
- Reproducibility: configs, fixed seeds, CLI entry points (train/eval/infer), deterministic builds.
- Quality gates: lint/format and tests on push (GitHub Actions); type hints where useful.
- UX discipline: accessible, responsive UIs with proper loading/error states and API retries.


---

## Currently working
- Modularising computer-vision tools into `cv_lib` (detection, embeddings, indexing, I/O, drawing).
- Targets: stable APIs, unit tests + CI, FastAPI endpoints, ONNX Runtime (CPU/GPU), docs, and pip packaging.
